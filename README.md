## Train Scheduling project with the help og Graph Theory

### Algorithm Used
- BFS, DFS
- Dijkstra algorithm
- Heap and Heap Sort

other basic algorithms

This Project have this following functionality:

- Print complete train schedule for all stations

- Print complete train schedule for a specific station

- For a station name, look up station number

- For a station number, look up the satation name

- Determine if there is a direct rout from station A to station B

- Determine if station B can be reached from station A

- For any two stations determine the shortests amount of time it will take to go from A to B wihtout
layovers(format: HH:MM)
  If no route exists, alert the user

- For any two stations determine the shortests overall travel time including layovers at stations (format:
HH:MM)
  If no route exists, alert the user

- For any two stations determine the shortest overall travel time including layovers at stations when
requesting to leave at a certain time (format: HH:MM)

- A passenger is able to say they want to leave at 09:30 and your program will take this into account
when choosing paths
